# Dragonfoxing.UnityCSharp

**About**

This project was an attempt to extract helper functions I commonly wrote for Unity into its own repository.

I no longer use Unity for various reasons, so it is not maintained, it may no longer work as expected, and there is no documentation for it.  Cloner beware.

If you do dare to use this, download this as a zip and remember to nuke the .gitignore from this project if present.
